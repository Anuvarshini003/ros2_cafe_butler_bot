Project Overview: 
The Café Butler Robot is a simulated service robot built to autonomously deliver food from a kitchen to multiple tables inside a café environment. It’s powered by TurtleBot3 Burger, simulated in Gazebo, and navigated via Nav2 (Navigation2) in ROS 2 Humble.
The robot follows user commands through a client interface, making it ideal for demonstrating state machine control, navigation, confirmations, cancellations, and timeouts within a dynamic simulation world.
