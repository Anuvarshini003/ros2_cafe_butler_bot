☕ ROS 2 Cafe Butler Bot (Humble)
An autonomous café delivery robot simulation built with ROS 2 Humble, TurtleBot3, Gazebo, and Nav2. This robot navigates a simulated café environment, picks up orders from the kitchen, and delivers them to tables — intelligently handling confirmations, cancellations, and timeouts through a simple command-line interface.
