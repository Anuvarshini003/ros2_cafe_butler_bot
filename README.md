â˜• ROS 2 Cafe Butler Bot (Humble)
An autonomous cafÃ© delivery robot simulation built with ROS 2 Humble, TurtleBot3, Gazebo, and Nav2. This robot navigates a simulated cafÃ© environment, picks up orders from the kitchen, and delivers them to tables â€” intelligently handling confirmations, cancellations, and timeouts through a simple command-line interface.

ðŸ“– Whatâ€™s This Project About?
This project simulates a smart service robot designed for cafÃ© environments. The robot moves between the kitchen and tables, taking food orders, waiting for confirmations, responding to cancellations, and efficiently managing delivery operations.

The system integrates:
~Nav2 for autonomous navigation
~Gazebo for realistic simulation
~ROS 2 nodes for robot control and user commands
~A clean, terminal-based client interface to manage deliveries

ðŸš€ Key Highlights
âœ¨ Autonomous navigation with obstacle-aware path planning
âœ¨ Real-time delivery control via terminal commands
âœ¨ Timeout handling for delayed responses
âœ¨ Cancel orders on the fly
âœ¨ Seven interactive test scenarios
âœ¨ Modular, clean ROS 2 Python package structure
âœ¨ Custom-built Gazebo cafÃ© world
